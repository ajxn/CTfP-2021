Question 1: Show that the function 𝑓 that is the pullback of 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒 along the
characteristic function must be injective.


Let's start with the simplest example

Set A has elements {1,2}
Set A' has elements {3}
Set B has one element {b}

Function f maps from Set A to Set B (both elements point to the single element in B (surjective function))
Function f' maps from Set A' to Set B (injective function)

Assuming above then there can be no isomorphism between f and f' breaking the composition 

h:: a->a' such that f=f' . h
