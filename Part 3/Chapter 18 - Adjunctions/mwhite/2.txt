2. Derive the counit ε starting from the hom-sets isomorphism in the second definition of the adjunction.

We are given that C(L d, c) ≅ D(d, R c). Since this holds for all d, set d equal to R c, so C(L (R c), c) ≅ D(R c, R c). We know that the right side contains at least id_(R c), so is nonempty.
We therefore have a family of morphisms in C(L (R c), c), which we can rewrite as C((L ∘ R) c, Id_C c), where Id_C is the identity functor on C. Picking arbitrary c and c' from C, and calling an
arbitrary morphism in C((L ∘ R) c, c) ε_c, we have the following diagram:

     ε_c
c  <----- (L ∘ R) c
|           |
| f         | (L ∘ R) f
V           V
c' <----- (L ∘ R) c'
     ε_c'


which, provided a morphism f: c -> c' exists, commutes.
