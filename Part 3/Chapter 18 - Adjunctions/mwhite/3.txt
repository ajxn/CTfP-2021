3. Complete the proof of equivalence of the two definitions of the adjunction.

To show that the two definitions are equivalent, we must show that given two functors L : D -> C and R : C -> D

1. the existence of the following natural transformations

η :: ID -> R ∘ L
ε :: L ∘ R -> IC

implies that C(L d, c) ≅ D(d, R c), and

2. if C(L d, c) ≅ D(d, R c), this implies the existence of η and ε (as defined above).



The derivation of the unit from the isomorphism of hom-sets is given in the text. The derivation of the counit from the isomorphism of hom-sets is exercise two.

The mapping of an arbitrary morphism f in the hom-set C(L d, c) to an element of the hom-set D(d, R c) is given in the text.

To complete the proof, we need only to provide a mapping of an arbitrary morphism g in D(d, R c) to an element of C(L d, c). This mapping is given by ε_c∘(L g).
